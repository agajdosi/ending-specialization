<p style="font-size:20px" id="paragraph-1">
Capitalism makes us into cogs in a machine.
In return for our work we get a chance to lubricate ourselves to achieve even more;
our wages lead us into a vicious cycle of ever more consumption.
We are specialised cogs for specialised purposes – human resources departments politely tell us we can’t fit anywhere else.
They motivate us with sugar to sweeten free break room coffee and with a stick of performance reviews.
</p>
<p style="font-size:24px" id="paragraph-2">
Whether we are self-employed or work for someone else we are dependent on our specialisation.
This is why anxiety overcomes us when we even think about the possibility of stepping out of the machine other than leaving it terminally on the way to the junk yard.
We wish to oppose not deep knowledge, understanding and expertise but overspecialisation that puts us under the yoke of our oppressors,
who make us economically and emotionally dependent on themselves.
</p>
<p style="font-size:28px" id="paragraph-3">
We wish to liberate ourselves by the expansion of our competence and by its joyous diversification.
We wish to liberate ourselves by rekindling our imagination and inviting diversity.
We wish to liberate ourselves by mutual care.
</p>
<p style="font-size:32px" id="paragraph-4">
Death to self-improvement and re-qualification!
We want to flee from iron cages of disciplines, which under the pretext of excellence made us hypertrophied here and feeble everywhere else.
The road from capitalism to a society without growth leads through the ending of overspecialisation!
